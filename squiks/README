Squiks
======

see https://johnleach.co.uk/getalife

These little pixel creatures just kinda wander around the screen, randomly
spawning and randomly dying.   They will eventually seek food and mates and
maybe solve complex mathematical equations, but for they they are just cute to
watch.

example:

# gcc -o squik squik-0.1.c -lSDL -lpthread
# ./squik
