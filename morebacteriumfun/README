Get A Life - John Leach <john@johnleach.co.uk>

v0.1	Initial test, one colour, ethnically true.
v0.2	3 Colours, similar rules.  Note dodgy rounding causing lines in growth
v0.3	Far more complicated one.  Each cell choose another cell to attack and
	attacks it until it is dead, then  moves in a bit slow and not great
	results
v0.4	Far cooler.  More variables, random mutations, better inheritance


Use the #define variables at the top to tweak the resolution.  Actual res is
double these settings, as each pixel is 2 pixels in size so things are bigger.

The black banding is cells dying then been replaced by surrounding spores.  It
is easier for other cells to spore into "dead" parts of the petri dish than
"live" ones so you tend to see other colours flourishing during these bands.

The mutating can causes lots of cool stuff.  There are a few variables that
aren't randomly set during the big bang, so would never occur "naturally", but
mutations can cause these.

Cells are a "living" pixel.  Particles are just points in the "universe" (ram)
